1. Open the TertiarySearch.java file in any IDE of your preference.
2. Once it is opened in the IDE, run the program.

NOTE: (I already defined a sorted array in the program.  ar[] = { 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 };
If the values needs to be changed, kindly change values as per the sorted order manually.)

3. After the execution of the program, the system prompts "Enter the value you want to search:  "
4. Kindly, give the value you want to search.
5. Once the input is given, if the value is present in the array, system prints the index of the value given by user.
6. If the input value is not present in the array, system will print -1.
