1. Open the LinkedList.java file in any IDE of your preference.
2. Once it is opened in the IDE, run the program.
3. After the execution of the program, the system prompts "Enter the required number of nodes in the list: "
4. Kindly, give the number of required nodes.

NOTE: (I used random function to get values to create a list with number of nodes as given input)

5. Once the input for the number of nodes is given, system prints the list before and after sorting.
