1. Open the DFSTopologicalSort.java file in any IDE of your preference.
2. Once it is opened in the IDE, run the program.
3. After the execution of the program, system prints the DFS Topological sort result for the graph on Image 1 followed by result for graph in Image 2.

NOTE:
1. The given graphs are already coded into the program as input.
2. The program only supports input vertices which are consecutive  integers or alphabets which are consecutive in the ascii table.
3. intitial_int value should be given as the first integer in the vertices when vertices are consecutive integers.
4. initiaL_char shld be given when vertices are consecutive characters in ascii table.
5. For the graph in Image 1, I have given the intial_int val as 1 to convert vertices to 0 to V.
6. For the graph in Image 2, I have given the intial_char as 'm' to convert node to 0 to V by using their ascii value.
