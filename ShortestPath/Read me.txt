1. Open the ShortestPathTree.java file in any IDE of your preference.
2. Once it is opened in the IDE, run the program.
3. After the execution of the program, system prints the vertices followed by the edges(pair of vertices) in the actual graph.
4. Then the system prints the source, vertex and the minimum distance of the vertex from the source.
5. And then system prints the edges that make up the shortest path tree.

NOTE:
1. The input graph has 10 vertices.
2. The vertex 0 is considered as source in the program.
